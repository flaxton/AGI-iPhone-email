## AGI iPhone email setup documentation

### Email from AGI with your email address and password

You should have received an email with your email address and password.

We're going to copy the password out of that email, because it is very long and difficult to type - which makes it secure :smiley:

On your iPhone, open that email:

![AGI email](./IMG_0990-edited.jpg "AGI email")

tap and release your finger on the password, and you'll see a blue selection, with a left and right "handle".

Most likely, the entire password will not all be selected.

Tap on the left "handle" and drag it to the left until the beginning of the password is selected.

Then tap and drag on the right "handle" until the end of the password is selected.

Now the entire password should be selected (highlighted in blue) like this:

![password highlighted](./IMG_0991-edited.jpg "password highlighted")

Great! Now you need to "copy" the password to the invisible clipboard on your iPhone.

Tap "Copy" in the black bar above the password to copy it.

The bar will disappear.

Now the password is on the invisible clipboard ;-)

### Settings

Now, launch the Settings app. It looks like a gear or fan icon, like this:
